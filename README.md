# sqlacademy-challenge

Utlized class notes and chatgpt to work my way through the homework. Ran into some issues in the beginning with connecting to the database, but was able to problem solve and correct the issue.  I saved the 'app' as a separate notebook instead of a python file to simplify for myself.

Notes for 'app' file:

/api/v1.0/precipitation:
View the last 12 months of precipitation data in JSON format.

/api/v1.0/stations:
View a JSON list of all stations.

/api/v1.0/tobs:
View temperature observations (TOBS) for the most active station for the last year.

/api/v1.0/<start>:
Replace <start> with a date (e.g., 2017-01-01) to see min, avg, and max temperatures from that date onward.

/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>:
Replace <start> and <end> with a date range to see min, avg, and max temperatures for that range.
